# antarctic-siz-stress

Looking at air-sea-ice interactions (e.g. surface stresses, Ekman pumping) in the Antarctic sea ice zone.

## Conventions
1. Latitude = -90 (90 S) to +90 (90 N)
2. Longitude = -180 (180 W) to +180 (180 E)

## Warning
I feel like this repo is full of ugly data analysis code that I wish I could go back and rewrite... In particular, I would use [xarray](http://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/) to read, write, and manipulate datasets, [iris](https://scitools.org.uk/iris/docs/latest/index.html) for data analysis, and [dask](https://docs.dask.org/en/latest/) for distributed computing.
